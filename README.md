# Project Overview:
This project involved analyzing Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas as the database platform. Through Python scripting and Pandas, I retrieved and preprocessed the dataset, addressing missing values and ensuring data integrity. The Streamlit web application I developed allowed users to explore interactive geospatial visualizations, pricing trends, and availability patterns. Using Plotly and Seaborn, I conducted in-depth analyses, investigating location-based insights and creating dynamic plots to visualize pricing variations, occupancy rates, and demand fluctuations across different seasons and regions. The final deliverable included a comprehensive dashboard built with Power BI, combining various visualizations to present key insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making in the travel and property management sectors.

# Key Achievements:
-> Established MongoDB connection and retrieved Airbnb dataset efficiently.
-> Implemented data cleaning and preprocessing techniques for accurate analysis.
-> Developed a user-friendly Streamlit web application with interactive maps and charts.
-> Conducted thorough price analysis, availability assessment, and location-based insights.
-> Created an insightful dashboard using Power BI, showcasing key findings and trends.

# Learning Outcomes:
This project significantly enhanced my skills in Python programming, data preprocessing, and visualization techniques. I gained hands-on experience in working with MongoDB Atlas, Streamlit, Plotly, Seaborn, and Power BI, which are invaluable tools in data analysis and presentation. Additionally, exploring the travel industry domain provided insights into property management, tourism trends, and data-driven decision-making processes.

Overall, this project was instrumental in developing my analytical capabilities, problem-solving skills, and collaboration in managing end-to-end data analysis projects within the travel and tourism sector.
